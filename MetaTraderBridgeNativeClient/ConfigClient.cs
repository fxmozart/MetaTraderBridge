* Named pipe is a mechanism for one-way or duplex inter-process communication
*  between the pipe server and one or more pipe clients in the
* local machine or across the computers in the intranet:
* 
* PIPE_ACCESS_INBOUND:
* Client (GENERIC_WRITE) ---> Server (GENERIC_READ)
* 
* PIPE_ACCESS_OUTBOUND:
* Client (GENERIC_READ) <--- Server (GENERIC_WRITE)
* 
* PIPE_ACCESS_DUPLEX:
* Client (GENERIC_READ or GENERIC_WRITE, or both) <--> 
* Server (GENERIC_READ and GENERIC_WRITE)
* 
* This code sample demonstrate two methods to use named pipe in Visual C#.
* 
* 1. Use the System.IO.Pipes namespace
* 
* The System.IO.Pipes namespace contains types that provide a means for 
* interprocess communication through anonymous and/or named pipes. 
* http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.pipes.aspx
* These classes make the programming of named pipe in .NET much easier and 
* safer than P/Invoking native APIs directly. However, the System.IO.Pipes 
* namespace is not available before .NET Framework 3.5. So, if you are 
* programming against .NET Framework 2.0, you have to P/Invoke native APIs 
* to use named pipe.
* 
* The sample code in SystemIONamedPipeClient.Run() uses the 
* Systen.IO.Pipes.NamedPipeClientStream class to connect to the named pipe 
* "\\.\pipe\SamplePipe" to perform message-based duplex communication. The
* client then writes a message to the pipe and receives the response from the 
* pipe server.
* 
* 2. P/Invoke the native APIs related to named pipe operations.
* 
* The .NET interop services make it possible to call native APIs related to 
* named pipe operations from .NET. The sample code in 
* NativeNamedPipeClient.Run() demonstrates calling CreateFile to connect to 
* the named pipe "\\.\pipe\SamplePipe" with the GENERIC_READ and 
* GENERIC_WRITE accesses, and calling WriteFile and ReadFile to write a 
* message to the pipe and receive the response from the pipe server. Please 
* note that if you are programming against .NET Framework 3.5 or any newer 
* releases of .NET Framework, it is safer and easier to use the types in the 
* System.IO.Pipes namespace to operate named pipes.
